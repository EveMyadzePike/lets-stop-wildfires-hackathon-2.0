## OFFICIAL LAUNCH DATE: JUNE 20, 2020

## GOAL: Build Deployable Wildfire Smoke Detection Models for HPWREN Cameras

## REGISTER [HERE](https://forms.gle/wM7zRPFMUQptpygX9) 

**Lets Stop Wildfires Hackathon 2.0** is a reboot of the last successful [wildfires hackathon](https://aiformankind.org/lets-stop-wildfires-hackathon) organized by [AI For Mankind](https://aiformankind.org). 

In the last Lets Stop Wildfires Hackathon which was launched in 2019, we focused on classification of smoke on the whole image or gridded image. In this hackathon, we want to formulate the problem as smoke detection and segmentation. We present the following challenges for our participants to solve. Special thanks to [HPWREN](http://hpwren.ucsd.edu/) to provide access to HPWREN camera images.

1. Detect Wildfire Smoke using Bounding Boxes
2. Detect Wildfire Smoke using Segmentation Masks
3. Bonus: Detect Wildfire Smoke using Temporal Sequences.

Do you know there are many cameras installed around mountaintop in California. These are the HPWREN and AlertWildfire cameras.

**Can your wildfire detector beat the "AI For Mankind: SUPER DUPER WILDFIRE SMOKE DETECTOR" ?** 

### GET STARTED 
While waiting for the official release of annotated dataset, you can checkout our quick start repo for building a wildfire smoke detector. It comes with a docker image and sample dataset to get you started.

We believe that open sharing and collaboration are important in accelerating innovation and driving meaningful change locally and globally. Public and private partnerships coupled with citizen participation can help win the fight against wildfires. 

Everything built during the hackathon will remain as open source with The MIT license. 

Our [previous hackathon](https://aiformankind.org/lets-stop-wildfires-hackathon) was a success. Participants engaged in discussions shown in pics below.
