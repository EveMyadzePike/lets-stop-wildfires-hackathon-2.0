# lets-stop-wildfires-hackathon-2.0

Lets Stop Wildfires Hackathon 2.0 is a reboot of the last successful [wildfires hackathon](https://aiformankind.org/lets-stop-wildfires-hackathon) organized by [AI For Mankind](https://aiformankind.org). The theme of this hackathon is build deployable wildfire smoke detection models for HPWREN mountain top cameras. 

We believe that open sharing and collaboration are important in accelerating innovation and driving meaningful change locally and globally. Public and private partnerships coupled with citizen participation can help win the fight against wildfires. 

Everything built during the hackathon will remain as open source with The MIT license. Special thanks to [HPWREN](http://hpwren.ucsd.edu/) to provide access to HPWREN camera images.

**Note: If you wish to keep your idea/project private, please do not enter this hackathon.**

#### [Wildfire Smoke Detection Challenge](wildfire_smoke_challenge.md)
Do you know there are more than 250 cameras installed around mountaintop in California. These are the AlertWildfire camera system. Another camera system is called HPWREN cameras.

- [AlertWildfire Cameras](http://www.alertwildfire.org/southeastbay/index.html?v=518dd6a)

- [HPWREN Cameras](http://hpwren.ucsd.edu/cameras/I/wc-e-mobo-c.html)

Can you build a wildfire smoke detector for these cameras ?
